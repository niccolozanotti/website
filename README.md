# Personal website using Academic Hugo Template

For information on the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template used check out [pmichaillat/hugo-website](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website/)

> [!WARNING]  
> In order to build the website from hugo source files, note that an older version of hugo is used, [v0.128](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.128.0). I've found that some breaking changes occured between that version and the latest one (`v.146`).
